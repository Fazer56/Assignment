This is the sci-fi based UI I created for my semester 1 OOP assignment in Processing.
The UI has a loading page, a menu page with various options and charts with information about the planets in our solar system. It also has a simulation for a spaceship cockpit with different buttons.

List of favourite features: Loading screen stars and Beatbox

1.	Loading screen stars.
The stars on my loading screen, are drawn on the screen every time the mouse is pressed at the x and y position of the mouse. These stars are stored in an ArrayList and are then drawn onto a grid in the StarMap menu option. This took me a while to figure out how to do so I was happy when it worked. 


2.	BeatBox in the space ship Cockpit.

For this feature I used the minim processing library. I downloaded some cool sci-fi sounds and when you click one of the buttons on the beatbox it plays the sound.
You can also see the frequency of the sound. Which is mapped onto two lines.
